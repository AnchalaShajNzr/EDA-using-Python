# EDA-using-Python
This project involved performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of world population data up to 2022 using Python.
The analysis focused on understanding population growth trends, regional distributions, and demographic patterns over time.
Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I cleaned and visualized the data to uncover key insights.
The project highlighted significant factors driving population changes and provided a clearer picture of global demographics,                                                         helping to contextualize historical and current population trends.
